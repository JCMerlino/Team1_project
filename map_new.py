Her window has the lamest view of city life possible. Who actually wants to look outside and see depressed city workers going about their daily buisiness? 
Two chairs are always facing her desk. One for the person she's fireing and one for the person she's hiring to take their place. Of course they both sit there at the same time and it's supposed to strike fear into 
the new employees soul or somrthing. Her desk is cluttered with "important" uninportant things such as her mini big ben and electronic pencil sharpener. I think I see a small microphone on her desk.
