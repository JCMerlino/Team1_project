The last time he handed me one of these he left extremely illegal pornography that really made me question his functioning capacity as a human being. 
He told me to plug this into the mainframe and log on. Of course he didn't give me the login details so I'll have to go find out some. 
I'm sure it would have made my life a lot easier if he gave me details but I assume he wants me to use someone else's account so the blame goes on them if it screws up. 
Pretty smart. I think I'll screw up Bob's account."""
