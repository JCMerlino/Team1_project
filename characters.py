    The organisations choice to use paper documents stems from the statement that a 
    computer can be hacked but a physical document has to be stolen. As a result Bob's job
    was created so that normal file handelers can proceed with the necessary stapling etc

    to him based on his capacity to memorise information. On the surface you'd assume he 
    was an intellect but his memorisation patterns allow him to recall information from 
    months beforehand at a seconds notice. He is extremely unappreciated by his fellow 
    co-workers as they always claim a computer system could do his job better but he 
    never lets it get to him. In his mind he only needs to be appreciated by Samantha

    department to be present. The high funding and necessity for technology provides 
    Stephen with a well paid and secure job. Dr Stephen Arding was arrested multiple 
    times for accounts of unregulated experimentation and forging of scientific 
    documents. His defence was that the power of information should not be put in the 
    hands of corrupted politicians. Dr Arding was given an opportunity out of his 4 
    life sentences and he took it eagerly. The organisation was looking for a research
    scientist who's absence wouldn't be noticed. Therefore an operation was held in 
    which Alexa and Bruce broke into the high level security jail and retrieved the Dr
    whilst planting a replacement identical body of Dr Arding with his DNA all over 
    him. The official autopsy eventually reveled that the body wasn't Dr Arding 
    however he had been missing for long enough that the government believed the 
    investigation trails would have gone cold. Despite his reputation the government
    closed the investigation because they believed he woulnd't have access to high 
    tech equiptment without them realising. Little did they know he was hired right 
    under thier noses and was eventually working for them. During his time at the 
    organistion he has gained a decent reputation however in order to keep his true
    identity secret his surname and status was never revealed to the other operatives.
    To them he is just Stephen much like how Q is to 007.""",

    they are concerned she was a high performing field operative for the marines but 
    was dishonourably discharged due to a direct violation of orders from her 
    commanding officer. Her true backstory is only known by Samantha who was told when
    she took over the operation. The passing of laws against human experimentation led
    to the conviction of many "backstreet" Dr's trying to experiment on those who were
    poor enough to donate their bodies in hopes of surviving experimentation and 
    claiming a reward the Dr's so boastfully advertised. Alexa was abducted from her 
    high school in Latvia at the age of 14 but managed to escape from the facility
    she was kept at after an experiment on her nervous system gave her increased 
    reflexes and cognitive ability. She remained wandering the streets of Riga until 
    the age of 16 where she was brought into an orphanage on the assumption she had 
    lost her parents. When the orphanage learned of her high cognitive function they 
    alerted the Latvian government, however the transport of her was intercepted by 
    the organisation and she was re-conditioned to become a field operative for them.
    Her re-conditioning allowed her to re-adjust to her life and while she is always
    second to Bruce she keeps trying to push her limits in hopes that she will surpass 
    him. Her family and home are but distant memories that barely exist and now all she 
    focuses on is her work and what she does to protect others so that they may not
    experience the horrors she had faced as a young teenager.""",
