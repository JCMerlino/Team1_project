	Samantha : Oh whats the point. She's practically unsavable now and
	now she's gone we won't have an information leak. Just clean up
	blood and dump her body somewhere.

	Bruce : Wow you are cold.

	Samantha : I would have thought you'd have better field agent
	judgement and that you'd have shot her leg. You're on suspension for
	a week to re-collect your thoughts. When you're back I want you sharp

	spills the secrets. Maybe a knife pressing into this open wound would
	persuade her to talk.

	Bruce : Uhh since when have you been into this sort of thing?

	Samantha : Oh I was very good at interogating from when I used to be
	a field agent too.

	Bruce : Shouldn't you check her in case she has another grenade?

	Samantha : If she does she still won't be able to flee and that
	definately means she won't use a lethal one if she has one.
