	spills the secrets. Maybe a knife pressing into this open wound would
	persuade her to talk.

	Bruce : Uhh since when have you been into this sort of thing?

	Samantha : Oh I was very good at interogating from when I used to be
	a field agent too.

	Bruce : Shouldn't you check her in case she has another grenade?

	Samantha : If she does she still won't be able to flee and that
	definately means she won't use a lethal one if she has one.
